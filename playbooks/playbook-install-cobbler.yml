# In order to import Cobbler distributions, you will need a DVD ISO for your
# distribution.
# NOTE: You must use a full DVD, and not a "Live CD" ISO.
# By default we use the CentOS 7 x86_64 ISO, available for download here.

# $ mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /path/to/isos/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso /mnt
