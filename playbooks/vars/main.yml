# Cobbler is the only fully supported and functional way
# to deploy an OpenStack environment with ONPC/OSA.
# Other node provisioning tools (such as MAAS) has been
# used with varios degrees of succuess and as such are
# fully tested nor supported out-of-the-box. Some tweaking
# in the master install / setup playbooks may be required.
onpc_install_cobbler: True

# onpc_limited_connectivity should be set to 'True' in
# environments with no external (Internet) connectivity
# besides the master node. The master node setup will
# install Squid as a proxy server for the environment
# when onpc_limited_connectivity is set to True.
# If onpc_limited_connectivity is set to False, Squid
# will not be installed which requires all nodes of the
# OpenStack environment to have full access to the Internet
# to download packages.
onpc_limited_connectivity: True

# The proxy server (squid) installed on the master node
# can either work transparently on TCP port 3128 (default)
# or as an explicit proxy bound to port 8000.
