# Cobbler is the only fully supported and functional way
# to deploy an OpenStack environment with ONPC/OSA.
# Other node provisioning tools (such as MAAS) has been
# used with varios degrees of succuess and as such are
# fully tested nor supported out-of-the-box. Some tweaking
# in the master install / setup playbooks may be required.
onpc_install_cobbler: True

# In situations where the Internet access is blocked from
# the target nodes, a proxy server (Squid) can be
# installed on the master node to remedy this problem.
# Internet access is required to be able to get the
# needed resources during the deployment phase such as
# packages, LXC container images, Ansible roles and so
# so on.
# Check https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/latest/user/limited-connectivity
# for additional details.
#
# Three proxy modes are supported.
# - transparent: Internet access is mediated through the
#                proxy in a transparent manner. No proxy
#                settings is needed to access the Internet
#                from the target nodes.
# - transient: Internet access is mediated through the
#              proxy only during the deployment phase.
#              Target nodes clients such as wget will not
#              be able to access external resources after
#              deployment.
# - permanent: Internet access is mediated through the
#              proxy during and after deployment.
#              Caution must apply for large deployment because
#              The maximum length of no_proxy should not exceed
#              1024 characters.
